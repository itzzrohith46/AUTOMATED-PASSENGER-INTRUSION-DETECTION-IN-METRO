# AUTOMATED-PASSENGER-INTRUSION-DETECTION-IN-METRO
This project detects real-time passenger intrusion on metro platforms using Raspberry Pi and Pygame. It monitors the yellow line area and triggers an audio warning if a passenger crosses it. The system also sends an SMS alert to the station controller through a GSM module. It is designed to be low-cost, efficient, suitable for safety monitoring.
